# Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering

This repository contains a Python script that applies the K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The clustering is performed on the features "Annual Income (k$)" and "Spending Score (1-100)".

## Dataset
The dataset `Mall_Customers.csv` includes the following columns:

- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer
- **Age**: Age of the customer
- **Annual Income (k$)**: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars
- **Spending Score (1-100)**: A score assigned by the retail store based on customer behavior and spending nature

## Project Structure
- `customer_segmentation.py`: Main script to load data, apply K-means clustering, and visualize the clusters.
- `Mall_Customers.csv`: Dataset containing customer information.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python packages:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Running the Project
1. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd customer-segmentation
```

2. Ensure you have the dataset file `Mall_Customers.csv` in the same directory as the script.

3. Run the script:
```bash
python customer_segmentation.py
```

## Script Functionality
The script will:
1. Load the customer data into a pandas DataFrame from `Mall_Customers.csv`.
2. Select the relevant features ("Annual Income (k$)" and "Spending Score (1-100)").
3. Apply K-means clustering to segment the customers.
4. Visualize the resulting clusters using a scatter plot.
5. Print the first few rows of the DataFrame with the cluster assignments.

## Example Output
The script will display a scatter plot showing the customer segments based on their annual income and spending score. Each segment will be represented by a different color.
